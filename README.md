# GIS_StLouis_HYDRO_AreaWater
This repository contains files that constitute an ESRI shapefile depicting the River des Peres and the Mississippi River in St. Louis City. This shapefile was created from 2015 TIGER/line AreaWater shapefiles for St. Louis City (MO), Madison County (IL), and St. Clair County (IL). By combining these shapefiles, the full shoreline of the Mississippi River can be displayed for the entire length of the St. Louis City boundary.
